# Student CGPA Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project is a full-stack machine learning application that predicts a student's **CGPA** based on lifestyle and academic behavior factors. It combines a trained ML regression model with a **React frontend** to provide an interactive prediction system.

The goal is to analyze how daily habits influence academic performance and visualize predictions in a simple web interface.

Objective

To build a regression-based system that predicts CGPA using student lifestyle parameters such as study habits, sleep, stress, and extracurricular activities.

Features Used

- Study Hours
- Extracurricular Hours
- Sleep Hours
- Social Hours
- Physical Activity Hours
- Stress Level

Machine Learning Model

- Linear Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest Regressor (improved accuracy)
- Feature scaling and preprocessing applied

Tech Stack used

Frontend:

- React.js
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend / ML:

- Python
- Flask (or FastAPI if used)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy

Project Workflow

1. Data collection (student behavior dataset)
2. Data preprocessing & cleaning
3. Feature selection
4. Model training (regression models)
5. Model evaluation
6. Backend API creation (ML model serving)
7. React frontend integration
8. Real-time CGPA prediction UI
